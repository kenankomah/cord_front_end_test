In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000]

I only rendered the discover page http://localhost:3000/discover as it was the only one included in the mockups, all other pages were left blank.

I mainly used functional React components, mainly so that I can use hooks, but in some places I kept the class components if I felt there
was no need to change them.
